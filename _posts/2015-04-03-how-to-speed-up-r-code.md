Dear codeRs,

I recently found a very comprehensive document on how to speed up R code and wanted to share it with you!
It covers various aspects such as identifying where is your code slowing down, parallel computing, interfacing C code with R etc.
Don't hesitate and go have a look <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00855v1.pdf" title="how to speed up R code">here</a>
