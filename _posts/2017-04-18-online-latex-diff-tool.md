Hi PubliGISer,

You want to publish the revision of your awesome paper but you need a track change to meet reviewers' requirements and you do not know how to get it? You are desperate and think that you will not be able to realize your dream of a successful research career?

<a href="https://3142.nl/latex-diff/">Online LaTeX diff tool</a> is the TOOL you are looking for.

Just copy paste the old and the new latex files and this tool will automatically compute the difference between the 2 documents.

Problem solved.
